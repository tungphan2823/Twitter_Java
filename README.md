Project Name: Mini-Twitter
Project Description:
Mini-Twitter is a simplified version of Twitter, designed to mimic some of the core features of the popular social media platform. The application is built using modern technologies such as React.js, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL.

Frontend (React.js):
The frontend of Mini-Twitter is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can post tweets, follow other users, and view a feed of tweets from the users they follow. The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs.

Backend (Spring Boot):
The backend of Mini-Twitter is built using Spring Boot, a framework that simplifies the setup of Spring applications. It handles user authentication, data processing, and business logic. It provides APIs for user registration, login, posting tweets, following/unfollowing users, and fetching the tweet feed.

Database (PostgreSQL):
PostgreSQL, a powerful, open-source object-relational database system, is used to store and manage data for Mini-Twitter. It stores user information, tweets, and the relationships between users (who follows whom).

Key Features:
User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account and log in.
Tweet Posting: Users can post short messages (“tweets”).
Follow/Unfollow Users: Users can follow other users to see their tweets in their feed.
Tweet Feed: Users can see a feed of tweets from the users they follow.
Future Enhancements:
Like and Retweet: Allow users to like and retweet posts.
Profile Customization: Allow users to customize their profile with a bio, profile picture, etc.
Direct Messaging: Allow users to send direct messages to each other.
